    abstract = {The number of newly published vulnerabilities is constantly
                increasing. Until now, the information available when a new
                vulnerability is published is manually assessed by experts using
                a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vector and score.
                This assessment is time consuming and requires expertise. Various
                works already try to predict CVSS vectors or scores using machine
                learning based on the textual descriptions of the vulnerability
                to enable faster assessment. However, for this purpose, previous
                works only use the texts available in databases such as National
                Vulnerability Database. With this work, the publicly available
                web pages referenced in the National Vulnerability Database are
                analyzed and made available as sources of texts through web
                scraping. A Deep Learning based method for predicting the CVSS
                vector is implemented and evaluated. The present work provides a
                classification of the National Vulnerability Database’s reference
                texts based on the suitability and crawlability of their texts.
                While we identified the overall influence of the additional texts
                is negligible, we outperformed the state-of-the-art with our Deep
                Learning prediction models.},

    abstract = {Software vulnerabilities play a major role, as there are
                multiple risks associated, including loss and manipulation of
                private data. The software engineering research community has
                been contributing to the body of knowledge by proposing several
                empirical studies on vulnerabilities and automated techniques to
                detect and remove them from source code. The reliability and
                generalizability of the findings heavily depend on the quality of
                the information mineable from publicly available datasets of
                vulnerabilities as well as on the availability and suitability of
                those databases. In this paper, we seek to understand the anatomy
                of the currently available vulnerability databases through a
                systematic mapping study where we analyze (1) what are the
                popular vulnerability databases adopted; (2) what are the goals
                for adoption; (3) what are the other sources of information
                adopted; (4) what are the methods and techniques; (5) which tools
                are proposed. An improved understanding of these aspects might
                not only allow researchers to take informed decisions on the
                databases to consider when doing research but also practitioners
                to establish reliable sources of information to inform their
                security policies and standards.},

                decision-making processes. In this case study, we also analyse

    abstract = {Quantifying the coherence of a set of statements is a long
                standing problem with many potential applications that has
                attracted researchers from different sciences. The special case
                of measuring coherence of topics has been recently studied to
                remedy the problem that topic models give no guaranty on the
                interpretablity of their output. Several benchmark datasets were
                produced that record human judgements of the interpretability of
                topics. We are the first to propose a framework that allows to
                construct existing word based coherence measures as well as new
                ones by combining elementary components. We conduct a systematic
                search of the space of coherence measures using all publicly
                available topic relevance data for the evaluation. Our results
                show that new combinations of components outperform existing
                measures with respect to correlation to human ratings. nFinally,
                we outline how our results can be transferred to further
                applications in the context of text mining, information retrieval
                and the world wide web.},

    abstract = {The Dirichlet distributions have long been the subject of
                intense scrutiny in statistics and probability. Despite the
                enormous interest in, and wide-ranging applications of, these
                distributions, little appears to be known about their history. In
                this article we review the development of the Dirichlet
                distributions and their companions, the Liouville distributions.
                After reviewing some integral formulas of Dirichlet and Liouville
                , we survey the theory and applications of these distributions in
                statistics. /// Les distributions de Dirichlet font depuis
